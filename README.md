# Programming and Scripting Project 2021

# The purpose of this project is to research Fisher's Iris data set and and write code in Python to  investigate  it.

# Background

Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

The data set consists of 150 records, broken down into five traits as below;

                           - Iris setosa
  (i) Species of Iris      - Iris virginica 
                           - Iris versicolor

  (ii)  Sepal width in cm

  (iii) Sepal length in cm

  (iv)  Petal width in cm

  (v)   Petal length in cm
